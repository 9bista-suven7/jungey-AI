# Jungey TV

A control center for a Samsung smart TV, and the command Jungey uses to drive it.

It is its own app, beside Jungey rather than inside it: a window of its own, a jar of its
own, its own settings. Jungey only runs `jungey-tv --json …` and says what comes back.

## Install

```bash
apps/tv/install.sh
```

That builds it and adds the `jungey-tv` command and **Jungey TV** to the app menu, for your
account. On Jungey OS it is already installed. `apps/tv/install.sh --uninstall` takes it
away again.

## First time

The TV has to be on and on the same Wi-Fi. Open Jungey TV, or run:

```bash
jungey-tv pair
```

The TV asks whether to allow "Jungey TV". Choose **Allow** with the TV's remote. That is
the only time it asks. To turn the TV **on** from standby as well as off, enable
*Settings → General → Network → Expert Settings → Power On with Mobile* on the TV.

## The window

Open **Jungey TV** from the menu, or run `jungey-tv` with nothing after it. Every part of
the TV is a card on one screen:

- **Television**: whether it is on, and a switch to turn it on or off
- **Sound**: volume up and down, five at a time, and mute
- **YouTube**: search, or paste a link to play it at once; the video shows under
  *Now playing*
- **Inputs**: HDMI 1 to 4, and the TV's own list of inputs
- **Navigate**: the arrows, OK, Back and Home, for the TV's menus, and a box that types
  into the TV's own keyboard - for the search box inside Netflix, Prime Video or any app
- **Apps**: the TV's apps, the usual ones first; click one to open it

The keyboard works too: arrows, Enter, Backspace for back, `+` and `-` for volume, `M` to
mute, `H` for home, Space to play.

### Searching

The search bar at the top, or the one in the YouTube card, opens the search over the whole
window, with two tabs of results to choose from:

- **YouTube**: twenty videos at a time with their thumbnails, length, channel, views and
  age, and *More results* for the next twenty. Filters, as on the website: All, Videos,
  Movies (full films, marked *Free with ads* or *Rent or buy*), Live, 20+ min and Newest.
  Click a video to play it on the TV.
- **Movies & shows**: films and series with their posters, and a button for each app on
  your TV that has it - Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, Tubi and the rest,
  marked *rent*, *buy* or *free* where it is not included. Click one to open it there.
  Services the TV has no app for are listed underneath.

Netflix opens at the title itself. Other apps open at their home screen, since they do not
accept a title from outside; type its name into the box under the arrows once the app's
search is open. When an app opens the TV's keyboard, the window notices and puts the
cursor in that box for you.

jungey-tv browse the office      open the window at a search's results
```

Add `--json` for `{"ok": true, "message": "…"}` instead of plain text; the message is
worded to be spoken, which is what Jungey does with it.

## Through Jungey

Mention the TV and Jungey hands the rest to Jungey TV:

```
turn on the TV
open Netflix on the TV
watch Stranger Things on Netflix
watch The Office on the TV
play lofi hip hop on YouTube on the TV
search YouTube for cooking videos on the TV    then: play number two / show them
search for Inception on the TV                 then: watch the first one / show them
type friends on the TV
TV volume down by 5
switch the TV to HDMI 2
pair the TV
```

*Watch* finds a film or series in your apps; *play* finds a YouTube video. After a search
Jungey reads out the top three and lists ten; for ten minutes "play number two" picks one,
and "show them" opens the window at every result.

Without the TV in the sentence, "volume up" and "open Netflix" still mean this computer.
Naming a streaming service is enough, though: "watch the office on peacock" goes to the TV.

## How it talks to the TV

- **Finding it**: a UPnP search, then the TV's own description on port 8001.
- **Buttons and apps**: the secure remote-control channel Samsung's phone app uses
  (WebSocket, port 8002). The TV issues a token when Allow is pressed; the TV's
  certificate is remembered at the same moment, and a different one later is refused.
- **YouTube**: DIAL on port 8080, the way a phone casts, so no account or key is needed.
  Searching asks the service YouTube's own website uses, twenty results a page.
- **Movies & shows**: JustWatch's listings of what streams where, from the service its
  website uses. It has no published API, so this may change without notice.
- **Typing**: the remote channel's text input, which fills whatever keyboard is open on the
  TV.
- **Waking it**: a Wake-on-LAN packet to the network address the TV reports.

Settings, including the token, are in `~/.config/jungey-tv/tv.json`, readable by you only.
Delete it to make Jungey TV forget the TV.

Tested with a 2019 Samsung 7 Series (UN55RU7100, Tizen). Samsung TVs from 2016 on use the
same channel; older ones do not.
